Earthquakes strike without warning, rapidly causing numerous deaths and injuries. When they occur on coastlines or mid-ocean, they can cause tsunamis, which leave additional devastation in their wake. In the aftermath of the largest quakes, widespread damage to residences and health facilities often means thousands of people are left homeless and in need of medical supplies and health care. Direct Relief partners with local organizations in affected countries to ensure those who are most vulnerable are able to receive the medication and care they need.
